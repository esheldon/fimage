Code for creating fake images of astronomical objects.

Includes code to create exponentials, dev, gaussian profiles.  Includes code to
create convolved images using numpy.

There is some basic code for doing unweighted statistics, for quick tests,
(you might use https://github.com/esheldon/admom for more detailed studies).

This code is still evolving, write more here...
